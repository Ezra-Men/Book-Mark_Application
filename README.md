# Book-Mark_Application
Using PHP to Build a Book-Mark System.
Users on this system should be able to do the following:
Users should be able to register their usernames and passwords. You need some
restrictions on the length and format of each username and password. You should store
passwords in an encrypted format for security reasons.
 ■ Users should be able to log in with the details they supplied in the registration process.
 ■ Users should be able to log out after they have finished using a site. This capability is not
particularly important if people use the site from their home PC but is very important for
security if they use the site from a shared PC such as at a library.
 ■ The site needs to be able to check whether a particular user is logged in, and then access
data for the logged-in user.
 ■ Users should be able to change their passwords as an aid to security.
 ■ Users should be able to reset their passwords without needing personal assistance from the developer.
